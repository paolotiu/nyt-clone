                CAMBRIDGE, Mass. — One night late in 1979, an itinerant young
                physicist named Alan Guth, with a new son and a year’s
                appointment at Stanford, stayed up late with his notebook and
                equations, venturing far beyond the world of known physics.

                He was trying to understand why there was no trace of some
                exotic particles that should have been created in the Big Bang.
                Instead he discovered what might have made the universe bang to
                begin with. A potential hitch in the presumed course of cosmic
                evolution could have infused space itself with a special energy
                that exerted a repulsive force, causing the universe to swell
                faster than the speed of light for a prodigiously violent
                instant.

                If true, the rapid engorgement would solve paradoxes like why
                the heavens look uniform from pole to pole and not like a
                jagged, warped mess. The enormous ballooning would iron out all
                the wrinkles and irregularities. Those particles were not
                missing, but would be diluted beyond detection, like spit in the
                ocean.
